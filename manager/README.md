# Working with me

**This is a work in progress. And always will be. Everything here is subject to change as I grow and change. Suggestions/PRs are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/sean-hart/personal-docs/blob/master/manager/README.md).**

## About me

Hi. I'm Sean (shart works too if you know too many people with this popular name). You are probably reading this because you either work with me, or have some interest in working with me in the future. Or somebody told you to read this for some other reason???

I've been in tech since around 2000.  Don't ask me about Windows, I really don't know. Have not touched a Windows machine since 2007.  I've worked at some large companies, some small companies, some places you've heard of, and some places I really hope you have not. Don't bother asking where I went to school. I didn't.  I started working at the age of 16 and never looked back.

In my free time I seem to have gravitated toward outdoor sports as time has worn on. My twenties were dedicated mostly to video games, but I don't seem to make the time for those anymore. These days I snowboard, manage a baseball team, picked up golf about a year ago, surf from time to time... Recently picked up a mid-range telescope, and have been pulling that out from time to time.

## My Job
My job is to help ensure the success of the company.  After that, the success of engineering as a group. I strongly believe that for any company to thrive, the employees need the support of their leadership. You know better what needs to be done in your areas of expertise than I will as you are the one closest to the problem. It is my job to make sure that you have the space to get your work done.

It is also my job to help you grow in your role and beyond. We will work together to define career and personal goals. You will know what you are being measured on, and you will know the impact that you have. It is my job to ensure that nothing comes as a surprise to you.

## Your Job
First off, everybody's job is to support the success of the company.  We are all part of the same team, striving for the same goal. If the company succeeds, we all succeed. We will all be asked to do things outside of our comfort zones from time to time, or to wear many hats, and that is to be expected.

After that, your biggest job is to communicate, not only with me, but with our team and customers as well (we serve engineering and the company).

## My dreams
### No more SSH
Someday, I'd like to turn off the ability to SSH to any machine.  This means that in everything we do, make sure that the data anybody needs is not locked away on some box somewhere.  Logs will be shipped, metrics stored elsewhere, and processes controlled remotely.  Which leads to...

### No more "fixing" machines
I've done the math.  It's really expensive to spend time fixing machines. If you spend more than 7 minutes "fixing" something, you've spent the more than it would take to run the most expensive AWS instance for an hour. Instead, let's make it easier and faster to destroy and replace failing instances rather than fixing where possible.  Let me know if you want me to show you the numbers of how I got here.

## My Pet Peeves
* Injustice of any kind - This probably stems from both of my parents being criminal lawyers, but I have an overdeveloped sense of justice and fairness. I will not tolerate treating people badly for any reason.
* Throwing things over "the wall" - Everybody should take ownership and help out if they can. Again, we are all here to help out the company.
* "Not My Problem" - Similar to the above, if it's a problem for the company, it's a problem for all of us.  Help out.
* Meetings where the organizer is late (especially habitually late) - How rude.

## Feedback
I am always striving to be better than I am currently, and welcome any and all opportunities to grow. I am under no delusion that I am perfect, and expect you to tell me about it early and often. You will see a lot of requests for feedback, but do not treat these as the only opportunity to give it. This will include surveys, retrospectives, one-on-ones, etc.

## Communication With Me
Communication is of utmost importance. In general, I prefer email as the main form of communication if things are not urgent.  Slack/chat is perfectly acceptable, but understand that I treat chat as asyncronous, and I will not always be checking and responding. Requests that require action can just go in the ticketing system. Flyby hallway chats with action items you can assume went into a black hole. In person or phone should be used for urgent matters.

You may get an email or slack from me off-hours or on the weekend. Leave it until Monday. And consider calling me out for working on the weekend.

## One on Ones
I will set up a weekly half hour one-on-one with you.  This time is your time, and can be used however you like. Usually the format will be casual discussion. I encourage you to come prepared with an agenda. If your week is packed and you want to move/cancel, feel free to propose that as well. I will also come prepared with discussion topics.

## Meeting Etiquitte
**General Rule: Don't waste anybody's time, including your own.**

Meetings will start on time. Period. If you are late, the meeting will start without you. The flipside of that is that meetings will end on time. There will be rare occasions that the conversation is not complete, and we will schedule a followup either immediately or shorly after. If ever a meeting is complete before the alotted time, we will end it there. There will be no "since we are all here" addons.

No Laptops in meetings I host unless you are presenting or taking notes. No phones in meetings either. It has been shown that eliminating the distractions that come from email and chat during meetings make meetings go faster. However, there will be certain meetings where you will be requested to bring your laptop for some purpose. It will be explicit in the meeting invite if there is a need for your laptop.

If a meeting is not useful to you, and you cannot contribute to the meeting, do not hesitate to excuse yourself. Your time is of utmost value, and I would rather you spent the time doing something useful.

If a meeting has no agenda, feel free to request one. If there is no agenda, there is no meeting.

## Challenge the norm
Challenge me. I am NOT the smartest person in the room. If I am, I've not done a good job hiring. No matter what your level is, if something I say or ask for is off-base, or just plain wrong, say something right then. I am fine with being wrong. I can't stand being wrong and nobody telling me about it.

Challenge your peers. Same goes for them.

There will be times that we disagree and there is no clear "right". Make sure that your opinion is heard, and that you have truly heard all of the other opinions in the room. At that point, we can disagree and commit. This does not mean that anybody is backing down, or has lost, but that we need to focus on action. This also does not mean "undermine from within". Once we commit, do everything in your power to make our way forward successful. Sometimes we will choose the wrong thing. That's how we learn.

## Scheduling time with me
My calander can be a mess, but don't hesitate to put time on my calendar if you want to get some face time outside of our normal 1:1s. Again, if it is urgent, call me or hunt me down.

## Oncall
We will be oncall for the things that we own. I will strave to make sure that we are not oncall for things that we cannot fix (like other people's code). This is a standard and expected part of the job that we do. After a rough night, I don't expect to see you in the office. Take the time to rest and recover. 

## Random
I drop f-bombs... and other bombs. 99.9999% of the time it is for emphasis, not directed at people. If you are offended by this, talk to me, and I'll try to clean up my act. In the mean time, sorry.
